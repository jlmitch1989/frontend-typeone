App Description:
My original vision for this app was for it to be a place for people needing
support within the Type-One community. I created a forum style application which
allows users to post and comment on posts. I intend on eventually adding a calendar
API which will allow users to post local events for supporting those with Type-One
Diabetes.


Associations:
User has many posts
User has many comments
Posts has many comments


Technologies Used:
Ruby on Rails
Ember.js
HTML
CSS
PostgreSQL


User Stories:
	As a user, I want to sign-up/sign-in, so I can be a part of this community.

	As a user, I want to be able to interact with a calender, so I can see local Boston events dealing with Type-1 Diabetes.

	As a user, I want to have access to the TypeOne forum, so I can share my experiences with Type-1 Diabetes with others.

	As a user, I want to be able to add, edit or delete threads that I have created in the forum, so I can be fully able to participate in the TypeOne community.

	As a user, I want to be able to add local events to the calendar, so others can be aware.
