## App Description:
My original vision for this app was for it to be a place for people needing
support within the Type-One community. I created a forum style application which
allows users to post and comment on posts. I intend on eventually adding a calendar
API which will allow users to post local events for supporting those with Type-One
Diabetes.

## Technologies Used:
